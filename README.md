# Project Concept: Hiragana Classification using CNN

**Data:** [Hiragana Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anokas/kuzushiji)

## Project Overview
Explore and preprocess the images of the dataset and create a CNN that classifies the given hiragana images.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Conduct exploration and visualization of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Normalize the arrays.

3. **Model Selection**
   - Develop multiple CNN models and assess their performance to determine the most suitable model.
   - Employ the chosen model to classify the test dataset and obtain the results.
